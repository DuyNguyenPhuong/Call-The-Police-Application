# Emergency Alert Global Verion 

## Overview

You are walking in a beautiful street in Rome and suddenly you got rob? What will you do? Search the internet to find the police number?
No thank you. Here comes Emergency Alert Global Verion, a mobile application that automatically call the police number based on your location. And you can activate it by saying a specific word.

This is actually how I was inspired to build this app. When travelling Europe, I was scammed right in front of the Effiel tower, got lost in Munich street and got robbed in Rome. However, in every country, the police number is different. Therefore, I built this app, which takes your location to get the emergency contact and call them whenever you say some words.

# This is how it looks like on your phone
